## Overview

Text classification is a supervised learning problem in machine learning, because the content of the text is labeled, and is used to perform the classification.
To solve a text classification problem, we perform 4 steps:

1. Data preparation
2. Feature engineering
3. Build model
4. Improve model and improve performance

## Contents

* Theoretical issues: multi-class problem in text classification.
* Machine learning method: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
* Demo: Spam classification with SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Tokenization - Word Segmentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirement:

* You have installed the latest version of Python.
* You have installed a Jupyter notebook.
* You have a basic understanding of machine learning in Natural language processing (NLP), Supervised learning, Text classification, Pretreatment, Tokenizer algorithm, Machine learning method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
